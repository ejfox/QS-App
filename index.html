	<p><strong>I want to help people easily learn about themselves and their habits through data.</strong></p>
	<p>By consistently keeping track of a set of metrics related to happiness, a user can determine how different life changes affect how happy they are. </p>



	<h3>Daily Check-ins</h3>
	<p>A user fills out two quick morning and evening check-ins, with simple 1&#8211;10 ratings of various metrics (<strong>mood, optimism, restedness</strong>). To gather how the day impacted a user’s a mood, we compare their <strong>AM mood</strong> to their <strong>PM mood</strong>. These ratings are averaged and compared day-over-day in beautiful visualizations, rewarding consistent updates. Check-ins can be made either in the mobile app, or through a desktop web interface.</p>

	<img src="qs_mockup2.png" />


	<p>Once a baseline of mood/happiness is established, a user can input habits that they wish to create or stop. These habits get added to a user’s PM check-in. <em class="quote">“What is your evening mood? Did you meditate today? Did you get inbox zero today? Did you read a book today?”</em>.
	</p>

	<p>Using that data a user can check whether habits increase their happiness. This creates a positive reinforcement and helps a user better understand what habits make them happier. </p>

	<img src="qys_metric_compare.png" />


	<h3>Simple interface</h3>
	<p>The interface is simple, minimal, and rewarding. A user is expected to be able to quickly check-in in the time after they read their email in bed while waking up, or after work as they wait for the water to boil while making dinner. A user can schedule reminders for their AM and PM check-ins, and the system eventually learns to adapt these reminder times to the user.</p>

	<h3>Desktop interface</h3>
	<p>The mobile app connects to a website, where a user can see more advanced reports based on the metrics they collect about themselves. Users will own their data and be able to export it in a variety of methods, including excel and CSV. The data collected by the app will also be made available in an easily-usable API, with code examples on GitHub, so that developer users are encouraged to perform their own analysis and visualization. </p>

	<h3>Adding Context</h3>
	<p>The web interface should eventually also allow a user to import metrics from other services to compare them to the happiness metrics the app collects. A user should be able to input their data from Twitter, Fitbit, RescueTime, Pocket, OpenDNS, Reddit, Wunderlist, and any other possible data source. From there a user can compare diverse metrics to their happiness baseline and come up with insights like <em class="quote">“My happiness increases 10% when I get a retweet on Twitter”</em>, <em class="quote">“When my happiness is above 7 I tweet twice as much”</em>, <em class="quote">“When I walk over 50,000 steps my happiness decreases 25%, but my restedness the next day increases 50%”</em>, <em class="quote">“When my restedness is over 6, I get an average of 8 to-do items done per day”</em>.</p>
